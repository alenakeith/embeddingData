2791,""Thank you very much for listening.Old man sunshine was proud of his sun,And it brightened his day to see his little boy run,Not because of what he’d done, nor the problems overcome,But that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one.It hadn’t always been like this.There’d been times when he’d tried to hide his brightness,You see, every star hits periods of hardship,It takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness.If we go back to when he was born in a nebula,We know that he never was thought of as regular,Because he had a flair about him,To say the Midas touch is wrongBut all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze,Yes this sun was loved by some more than others,It was a case of Joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothersBecause standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons,And jealousy created enemies in those he outshoneSuch as the Shadow People.Now the Shadow People didn’t like the Sunshine Kid,Because he showed up the dark things the Shadow People did,And when he shone he showed the places where the Shadow People hid,So the Shadow People had an evil plan to get rid of him,First up — they made fun of his sunspots,Shooting his dreams from the sky, their words were gunshots,Designed to remind him he wasn’t very coolAnd he didn’t fit in with any popular kids at school.They said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to Earth,Essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth,He’d never get to go to university to learn,Only degrees he’d ever show would be the first degree burnsFrom those that came too close, they told him he was too bright,That’s why no one ever looked him in the eyes,His judgment became cloudedSo did the sky, With evaporated tearsas the sun started to cry.Because the sunshine kid was bright, with a warm personality,And inside he burned savagelyHurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folkwho spoke holes in his soul and left cavities,And as his heart hardened, his spark darkened,Every time they called him names it cooled his flames,He thought they might like him if he kept his light dimBut they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim,He couldn’t quite get to grips with what they said,So he let his light be eclipsed by what they said,He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,And felt like he’d been punched in his solar plexus.But that’s when Little Miss Sunshine came alongSinging her favorite song about how we’re made to be strong,And you don’t have to be wrong to belong, Just be true to who you are,because we are all stars at heart.Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,The kind of girl when you looked at heryou forgot stuff,But for him, there was no forgetting her,The minute he saw her her image burned in his retina,She was out of this world, and she accepted him,Something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him,Things weren’t as dark as they seemed, and he dared to dream,Shadows were nowhere to be seen; when she was there he beamed,His eyes would light up in ways that can’t be faked,When she grinned her rays erased the razor-tipped words of hate,They gave each other nicknames, they were "cool star" and "fun sun,"And gradually the shadowy damage became undone,She was one in a septillion, and she was brilliant,Could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion,Loved by billions, from Chileans to Brazilians,And taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience.She said: “All the darkness in the worldcannot put out the light from a single candleSo how the hell can they handle your light?Only you can choose to dim it, and the sky is the limit, so silence the critics by burning.”And if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtainsAnd let the sun shine through the hurting.In a universe of adversity these stars stuck together,And though days became nights the memories would last forever,Whether the weatherman said it or not, it would be fine,'Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine.Yes, the Sunshine Kid was bright, with a warm personality,And inside he burned savagely,Fueled by the fire inspired across galaxiesBy the girl who showed him belief.Thank you very much.",2402,49
